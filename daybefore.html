<li><h5> What will you wear?</h5> </li>
<p> Different styles of clothes are appropriate for different situations. Have you found out what will be expected of you? Suit? Smart Casual? Casua? Uniform provided? Protective clothing provided? </p>

<li> <h5> What do you need to take?</h5> </li>
<ul>
<li>Directions / map / travel timetable</li>
<li>Letter with instructions from your employer </li>
<li>Name of person you are to report to on arrival </li>
<li>Money for bus fares, lunch, etc.</li>
</ul>

<li> <h5> What time will you get up? </h5> </li>
<p>Get a good night's sleep. Go to bed early and RELAX! Set your alarm clock . allow yourself enough time for a good breakfast. </p>
 
 <li> <h5> How long will it take to get there? </h5> </li>
 <p> If you are in rush or stressed about the day ahead, it's harder to concentrate on travelling safely. Use pedestrian crossings - do not try to save time by crossing where it's not safe. Don't dash across the road for a bus - there will be another one. You might need extra travel time to allow for weather conditions, roadworks, etc. Allow plenty of time for your journey so that you can get to the interview on time without taking unnecessary risks. </p>
 
 <li> <h5> What will you do when you are there?</h5> </li>
 <p> When you get there, go straight in and ask for the person you have been told to report to. </p>
</ol>
